##  📖 Overview

For this challenge, I used **ReactJS** with **Vite** to build a responsive **3-column preview card component**. The main goal was to create a layout that adjusts seamlessly depending on the screen size, ensuring an optimal user experience across devices.

**The challenge focused on two key aspects:**

-  **Responsive Design:** Building the layout to shift dynamically between different screen sizes, testing my ability to create fluid and adaptable layouts.
-  **Interactive States:** Implementing hover effects for interactive elements, enhancing the user experience and making the interface more intuitive.

I chose to use ReactJS to efficiently manage the component structure and ensure reusability, while Vite helped streamline the development process with fast builds. This challenge provided an excellent opportunity to practice handling responsiveness and user interactions in a real-world scenario.

###  🔬 What I learned

This project helped me practice working with **ReactJS** and its implementation alongside **Sass (or SCSS)**. I learned how to effectively integrate Sass into a React project to manage styles in a more modular and organized way. It also gave me hands-on experience in structuring components in React, using state and props, and understanding how to apply advanced CSS features like variables, nesting, and mixins in combination with **React's component-based architecture**.
